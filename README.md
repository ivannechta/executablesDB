This is a scientific project in steganography.
Steganography is the science that studies methods for cunstruction a secret communication chanel. Secret message embedds into some covertext (container) and can be transmited over open communication.
Such transmittion do not arrise any suspiction, but only receiver can corectly extract secret message from container and read it.

The most commonly uses containers is jpg files, but it can be also txt, avi, and executabe files (exe, dll, ...). In this project I create database with executable containers.
This database allows to provide scientific experiments with fixed set of files, so different steganographic algorithms can be compared in the same conditions.
